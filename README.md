- Simple memory game made with jQuery (css and js are outside files added to the key file in head and body):
two inputs allow to type words and put them into the box on the right by pressing the button Done.
Button Shuffle changes the position of the words in the box.
By clicking on the right word and it's translation the cards change background into green.
The game is over when all words have green background colour.
Note: the game starts only when you click on the words typed in the first input. 
The task is to find the right translation. It doesn't work vice versa yet.
